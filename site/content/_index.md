blurb:
  heading: Headless CMS?
  text: A content management for hugo site. This system lets noobs edit sites
    without having to code. Its actually pretty sweet even if you know how to
    code. I like the Live preview. split pane in the browser. you do need a
    github account synced to netlify and if you want to actually dig it and edit
    the templates its all in react.
